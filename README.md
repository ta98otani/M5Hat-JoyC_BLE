# M5Hat-JoyC_BLE Simulink Support Block

## Overview

### 
This is a code forked from M5Hat-JoyC to enable BLE transmission to a Robot.

This project include Simulink model to call M5Hat-JoyC library code to access JoyC I2C data. 

Intention is to send data to a M5Stack based robot via BLE. (Bluetooth Low Energy)

## Required Software
- Tested against MATLAB version R2024b and Arduino Hardware Support Package (Free Download)
- https://jp.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40312-simulink-support-package-for-arduino-hardware
- (It is best to use Add-on manager of MATLAB to install the addons)

## Procedure
1. Open M5HatJoyC_BLE23b.xls
2. Change hardware settings (COM Ports appropriately)
3. Build and Run
